# Word to Multimarkdown HTML footnotes

A small jQuery script to convert Word generated into TinyMCE HTML footnotes into your typical Multimarkdown generated HTML footnotes. Why? The syntax is somewhat better, and for those times you want to throw [bigfoot.js][bigfoot] into the mix. 

## How to use
Upload the *wordtoMMDfootnotes.js* (*wordtoMMDfootnotes-ck.js* is the compressed version) and add `<script type="text/javascript" src="wordtoMMDfootnotes.js" /></script>` somewhere after your jQuery reference (but before [bigfoot.js][bigfoot] if you use that). See [example][example].

I wrote this partly as an exercise in git and <strike>Javascript</strike>jQuery. Next step is to do this in vanilla Javascript.
